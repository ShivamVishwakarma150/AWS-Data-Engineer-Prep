To demonstrate the use of regular expressions in SQL, let's consider a hypothetical table named `elements` that stores information about various mythical elements. The table might have the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE elements (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```

Let's assume the `elements` table contains the following data:

```sql
INSERT INTO elements (name, description) VALUES
('Fire', 'Element of heat and energy'),
('Ice', 'Element of cold and stillness'),
('Water', 'Element of fluidity and change'),
('Earth', 'Element of stability and solidity'),
('Firestorm', 'A powerful and destructive fire element'),
('Icelord', 'A ruler of the icy realms'),
('Flame', 'A small and controlled fire element'),
('Frost', 'A light and delicate ice element');
```

### Example Queries Using Regular Expressions

1. **Find all elements whose names start with "Fire" or "Ice":**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM elements
   WHERE name ~* '^(Fire|Ice)';
   ```

   - `~*` is the case-insensitive regular expression match operator.
   - `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
   - `(Fire|Ice)` matches either "Fire" or "Ice".

   **Expected Result:**
   ```
   id |    name    |         description
   ----+------------+----------------------------
    1 | Fire       | Element of heat and energy
    2 | Ice        | Element of cold and stillness
    5 | Firestorm  | A powerful and destructive fire element
    6 | Icelord    | A ruler of the icy realms
    7 | Flame      | A small and controlled fire element
    8 | Frost      | A light and delicate ice element
   ```

2. **Find all elements whose names end with "storm":**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM elements
   WHERE name ~* 'storm$';
   ```

   - `storm$` matches "storm" at the end of the string.

   **Expected Result:**
   ```
   id |    name    |         description
   ----+------------+----------------------------
    5 | Firestorm  | A powerful and destructive fire element
   ```

3. **Find all elements whose names contain exactly four letters:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM elements
   WHERE name ~* '^[a-zA-Z]{4}$';
   ```

   - `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
   - `[a-zA-Z]{4}` matches exactly four letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
   - `$` asserts the position at the end of the string.

   **Expected Result:**
   ```
   id | name |         description
   ----+------+----------------------------
    1 | Fire | Element of heat and energy
    2 | Ice  | Element of cold and stillness
    7 | Flame| A small and controlled fire element
    8 | Frost| A light and delicate ice element
   ```

4. **Find all elements whose names do not start with "Fire":**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM elements
   WHERE name !~* '^Fire';
   ```

   - `!~*` is the case-insensitive regular expression not match operator.
   - `^Fire` matches "Fire" at the start of the string.

   **Expected Result:**
   ```
   id |    name    |         description
   ----+------------+----------------------------
    2 | Ice        | Element of cold and stillness
    3 | Water      | Element of fluidity and change
    4 | Earth      | Element of stability and solidity
    6 | Icelord    | A ruler of the icy realms
    8 | Frost      | A light and delicate ice element
   ```

5. **Find all elements whose names contain any digit:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM elements
   WHERE name ~* '\d';
   ```

   - `\d` matches any digit (0-9).

   **Expected Result:**
   ```
   (No rows, since none of the names contain digits)
   ```

### Summary

- **`~`**: Case-sensitive regular expression match.
- **`~*`**: Case-insensitive regular expression match.
- **`!~`**: Case-sensitive regular expression not match.
- **`!~*`**: Case-insensitive regular expression not match.
- **`^`**: Matches the start of a string.
- **`$`**: Matches the end of a string.
- **`|`**: OR operator in regular expressions.
- **`[]`**: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.
- **`{}`**: Specifies the exact number of matches.
- **`\d`**: Matches any digit.
- **`\w`**: Matches any word character (letter, digit, or underscore).
- **`\s`**: Matches any whitespace character.

These examples should give you a good understanding of how to use regular expressions in SQL to perform complex pattern matching on your data.
